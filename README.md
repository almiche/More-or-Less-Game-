# More-or-Less-Game-
Arduino game tested on MEGA 2560 platform

##What is it?
This is a simple game which requires 3 leds to be connected to an arduino board. An led for more on the right, an led for less on the left and finally another led in the middle for correct. The game takes place in the serial console. User is prompted to guess a randomly generated number between 1 to 15. Depending on the user input the lights will allow the user to know whether they are over or under the number.

##Get started
The image below is how the leds were setup on the board during testing. Replicating the setup will yeild the best results while playing.
